# NextJS Workshop: From Zero to Hero Dashboard

Welcome to the official repository of our comprehensive NextJS workshop, hosted at [https://github.com/naufaldi/reading-list](https://github.com/naufaldi/reading-list). This workshop is designed to take you on a transformative journey from the initial Request for Comments (RFC) to the final release documentation, showcasing the development of a project from the ground up.

## Workshop Overview

This workshop provides a hands-on experience in building a modern web project from scratch, utilizing a robust technology stack that includes:

- **NextJS**: A React framework for production-ready applications.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- **Supabase**: An open-source Firebase alternative providing all the backend services you need.
- **SteinsJS**: A streamlined library for efficient data handling and operations. (Note: Assuming SteinsJS as a fictional or context-specific library since it's not widely recognized)
- **TanStack**: A suite of libraries for building blazing-fast and easy-to-maintain applications.

## Objective

Our goal is to empower participants with practical insights and hands-on experience in initiating, developing, and deploying a project leveraging NextJS and related technologies. This workshop is built on a 'Zero to Hero' ethos, aimed at providing participants with a deep dive into modern web development practices.
